# About the project

This is my first project in React. Apart from React I used CSS, JavaScript and TypeScript. This project is about ordering cakes from a fake cake shop, in order to that I used session storage for keeping and updating order in a cart. The app also uses useState, useEffect and useNaviget hooks.The design of app is responsive due to display flex and display grid. Buttons in the app are connected with other elements by being disabled or not in certain conditions. App's inputs were made with RegEx.
